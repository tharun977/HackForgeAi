## Getting Started

To get started with HackForgeAi locally on your machine, follow the instructions below to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the application.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18.0.0 or higher)
- **pnpm** (v10.9.0 or higher)
- **Next.js** (v13.5.7 or higher)

If you donâ€™t have pnpm installed, you can install it globally with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tharun977/HackForgeAi.git
   cd HackForgeAi
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   The project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. To install the necessary packages, run:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Set up your environment variables for development. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project with the following structure:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your-api-url>
   DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
   CLERK_FRONTEND_API=<your-clerk-frontend-api>
   CLERK_API_KEY=<your-clerk-api-key>
   ```

   You may need to configure additional environment variables depending on your project needs.

## Running the Development Server

After installing dependencies and configuring environment variables, you can start the development server.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will generate an optimized production build that can be deployed to a platform like Vercel.

To run the production build locally, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Folder Structure

The project follows the typical Next.js folder structure:

```
/pages
  /api         - Contains API routes for server-side logic
  /auth        - Contains authentication-related pages
  index.js     - Main entry point of the app
/components
  - Reusable components such as UI elements
/lib
  - Contains utility functions and configuration files
/styles
  - Global styles (using Tailwind CSS)
  - Component-specific styles
```
